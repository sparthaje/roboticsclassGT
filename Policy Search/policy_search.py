# If you see different scores locally and on Gradescope, this may be because:
# - you forgot that the test cases for each are different (e.g., if your
#   solution is not robust enough, you may pass Test Case 4 locally but still
#   fail Test Case 4 on Gradescope, or vice-versa);
# - you are uploading a different file than the one you are executing locally
#   (i.e., if this local ID doesn't match the ID on Gradescope, this indicates
#   that you uploaded a different file), in which case you should use the
#   OUTPUT_UNIQUE_FILE_ID to determine if this is the case; and/or
# - you modified one of the other files in the project in a way that causes your
#   local results to differ (since those changes don't carry over to
#   Gradescope), in which case you should download a fresh copy of all the
#   project files.
